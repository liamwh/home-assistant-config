Hi, welcome to my Home Assistant Configuration repository containing the code I use to automate and control my home.

## Main features I use of my smart home:

- Bedroom lights fade on before my alarm goes off, helping circadian rhythm.
- Interior lights adapt colour temperature to the time of day automatically (more orange as sun goes down).
- Interior lights flash if I'm asleep and need to be woken up due to my blood sugar (I'm diabetic).
- Trigger my robot vacuum to clean on certain days of the week whilst I'm not home.
- Deliver notifications to my watch/phone of my blood sugar at certain times during the day if it's not in my target range.
- Modify lights and automations with "TV mode" during couch time.
- Modify lights and automations with "Night mode" whilst sleeping.
- Temperature controls.
- Music controls.
- Everything controllable by my voice assistant.

### Automations

- In the [/automations](https://github.com/liamwh/home-assistant-config/tree/master/automations) folder you will find the yaml files containing my automations.

### Configuration

- In the [/includes](https://github.com/liamwh/home-assistant-config/tree/master/includes) folder you will find the yaml files containing my configurations.

### Frontend
